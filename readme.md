Created a REST API for pants I am selling online
CRUD for pants is handeled in the django admin panel
views are handeled by rest_framework in views.py
    this was something cool I didn't know you could do with Django's rest_framework.
i added a URL link in serializers.py so you can select each individual pants instance.
the REST API allows you to pull data from the API in JSON and XML format.
